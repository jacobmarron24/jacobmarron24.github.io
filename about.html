	<h2>My Designs</h2>
	<p> The garments I design are inherently feminine with splashes or modernity and elegance. When designing I strive to create garments that are timeless yet practical to a modern day wearer. For me, designing is not only about making the world a more beautiful place but also about making individuals embrace who they are in their own skin.</p>

	<h2>My Story</h2>
	<p>I first got into the fine arts at a young age. My dad was a photographer by hobby, my mom and grandma both made jewelry to sell at local shows and my other grandma was an avid quilter. My real inspiration, however, was my older sister who taught me that there were still careers that required craftsmanship and the arts.</p>
	<p>While I experimented with other mediums as a young artist, in high school I decided that fashion design was my passion. To this day, I couldn't be more pleased with that choice. For me, fashion was the perfect mix of my creative side and my practical side, while being able to reach one of the largest markets in the world.</p1>
	<p>In August of 2014, I started studying fashion design at Kent State University where I also picked up a minor in entrepreneurship, joined their figure skating team (another passion of mine) and began their study abroad program in fall of 2016 to study fashion design in Florence, Italy.</p>
	<p>As a fashion designer, I am most inspired by my travels. At 21 years old, I have already been to over 20 countries across 5 continents. My dad instilled in me and my sister during these many adventures that cultural differences should not only be recognized, but embraced, for these differences are what make us unique as individuals. While my career as a fashion is just starting, I hope that the garments I work to create embrace the individuality of the wearer and bring joy and beauty into their everyday lives.</p>
